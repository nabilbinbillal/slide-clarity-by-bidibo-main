# 📚 Slide Cleaner by Bidibo

**Slide Cleaner by Bidibo** is a simple, fast, and fully client-side tool designed to help students turn messy classroom slides into clean, print-friendly notes. Many students struggle with dark slides, wasted paper, and unclear text when printing — especially when each slide ends up on a separate page. To solve this, Slide Cleaner provides an offline-capable solution that cleans slide backgrounds, improves clarity, and allows multiple slides to be arranged on a single page before exporting as a PDF.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

Most students face the same problems:
- Slides with dark backgrounds waste ink  
- One slide per page wastes 20–50 pages  
- Hard-to-read text after printing  
- Online converters require uploading files (privacy issues)  

I personally saw how difficult it was for students during exam prep, and how many pages were wasted.  
So I built **Slide Cleaner by Bidibo** — a tool that runs entirely on your device, cleans slides instantly, and lets you pack multiple slides onto one page. Students have already found it extremely helpful for saving paper and getting clearer, more readable printed notes.
